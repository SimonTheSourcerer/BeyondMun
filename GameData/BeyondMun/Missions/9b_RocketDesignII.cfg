    title = [BM] Design a Rocket with 12.0 tons Payload
    description = Design a rocket with a payload of minimum 12.0 tons. It should be rocket with a diameter of 2.5m that can mount 2.5m normal and extended fairings to carry the payload. To proof your remarking engineering skill bring the rocket in a stable orbit around Kerbin. Than we will check the mass of your vessel. If we aprove your skills we will pay a lot for the design!
    synopsis = Design a rocket with a payload of minimum 12.0 tons
    completedMessage = You have done it!
