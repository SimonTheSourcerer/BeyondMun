    title = [BM] Space Station Setup
    description = We have planned to setup our first space station in Kerbin's orbit. There will be four modules separately launched and added to the station in space. Our first module will be the core used as hub to connect the other three modules. The habitat, science and support module will follow as soon as possible.\n\nStarting with the Hub-Module we have setup some design criteria and leave the exact design to you. First of all the Hub-Module needs 3 additional docking rings for the other modules. The module should have capacity to store at least 2.000 units of energy and be capable of being automated without an astronaut (drone core). Do not forget to add an antenna to communicate with HQ.
    synopsis = We want to live in space!

    completedMessage = The foundation is set in place, for glories future in space!
